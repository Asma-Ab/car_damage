# Car Damage Assessment App

Welcome to the Car Image Analysis Streamlit App! This interactive application allows you to analyze car images using various algorithms, including AI image detection, damage severity assessment, damaged parts detection, and damage type detection.

# Overview

The application consists of several functionalities:

### 1. AI-Generated Image Detection

Determine whether the uploaded image is AI-generated or not.

### 2. Damage Severity Classification

Predict the severity of the damage in the car image. It can be Minor, Moderate, or Severe.

### 3. Damaged Parts Detection

Detect and highlight damaged parts and the damage type in the car image.
